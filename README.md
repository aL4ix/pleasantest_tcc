Bored of creating repetitive test cases? Refactoring lots of test cases just because one step changed? Why not try to code them instead.

TCC is a test case compiler! :) Code your test cases, have functions so you donâ€™t repeat yourself, test cases are maintainable, and you can create tons of test cases very easily, specially if they are repetitive. Export them to your desired format, import them into your test management tool and forget about tedious tasks.

Happy hacking!
